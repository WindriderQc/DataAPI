# Database Viewer Collection Access Fix

## Issue
The database viewer was showing a 404 error when trying to view the `mySessions` collection:
```
GET http://192.168.2.33:3003/api/v1/mySessions?skip=0&limit=10&sort=desc 404 (Not Found)
```

## Root Cause
The database viewer displays ALL collections found in the database (retrieved dynamically), but the API only exposes collections explicitly listed in the `collections` array in `/routes/api.routes.js`.

The `mySessions` collection exists in the database (used by express-session for storing user sessions) but wasn't exposed via API routes.

## Solution Applied
Added protected routes for the `mySessions` collection with **authentication required**:

```javascript
// Protected session collection - requires authentication
const sessionsController = genericController('mySessions');
router.route('/mySessions')
    .get(requireAuth, sessionsController.getAll)
    .post(requireAuth, sessionsController.create);

router.route('/mySessions/:id')
    .get(requireAuth, sessionsController.getById)
    .patch(requireAuth, sessionsController.update)
    .put(requireAuth, sessionsController.update)
    .delete(requireAuth, sessionsController.delete);
```

## Security Considerations

### Why Authentication is Required for Sessions
The `mySessions` collection contains:
- Active session IDs
- Session data (user IDs, login timestamps, etc.)
- Expiration information

**Making this publicly accessible would be a security risk** because:
- ❌ Anyone could see active sessions
- ❌ Session IDs could potentially be hijacked
- ❌ User login patterns and activity would be exposed
- ❌ Privacy violation (seeing who's logged in)

### Protection Applied
- ✅ All `/api/v1/mySessions` endpoints require authentication via `requireAuth` middleware
- ✅ Unauthenticated requests return 401 Unauthorized
- ✅ Only logged-in users can view session data
- ✅ Consistent with other sensitive collections

## Testing
After restarting the server:
1. **Without login**: `/api/v1/mySessions` should return 401
2. **With login**: Database viewer should now display mySessions data
3. **Database viewer**: Should no longer show 404 error for mySessions

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option 1: Add to public routes (NOT RECOMMENDED - Security Risk)
```javascript
const collections = [..., 'mySessions'];  // ❌ DON'T DO THIS
```
This would expose session data publicly.

### Option 2: Hide from database viewer (Limited Solution)
Filter out `mySessions` from the collection list in the view. This hides the problem but doesn't provide admin access to view sessions when needed.

### Option 3: Separate admin-only routes (Future Enhancement)
Create an `/admin/` route prefix with additional authorization checks (not just authentication):
```javascript
router.get('/admin/sessions', requireAuth, requireAdmin, sessionsController.getAll);
```

- `/routes/api.routes.js` - Added protected mySessions routes
- `/data_serv.js` - Session store configuration (line 146)
- `/controllers/genericController.js` - Used for session CRUD operations
- `/utils/auth.js` - `requireAuth` middleware

## Future Improvements
Consider implementing:
1. Admin-only access (`requireAdmin` middleware)
2. Session management UI (revoke sessions, view active users)
3. Session analytics (login patterns, active user counts)
4. Automatic session cleanup for expired sessions
